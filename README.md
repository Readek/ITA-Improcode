# ITA-Improcode

IT Academy's advanced React exercice. This project uses **VITE** and **REACT** as its base, and implements **MapBox** for its maps, **FullCalendar** for its calendar, and **ChartJs** for its charts.

This project connects to a backend project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Readek/ITA-Improcode-Backend). If a connection to the database can't be made, placeholder data will be used by the frontend, mimicking the data that you would get from the server.

You can try out the project by going to its [GitHub Page](https://readek.github.io/ITA-Improcode/).

---

You can also install it locally. Clone the repo and run:

```
npm install
```

You will then be able to run a developer enviroment with:

```
npm run dev
```

Note that you will be required to provide your own MapBox API key and place it on an `.env` file:

```
VITE_MAPBOX_APIKEY = ((your_api_key))
```
